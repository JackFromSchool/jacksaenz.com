         <p>This page will continue to grow and grow as I add more and more to it. Each entry is dated and displays a path of things I've been interested in.</p>

            From now on I'm going to stop talking about blogging more in these. The semester has finally ended, and I'm just itching to work on something in absence of the constant deadlines. With that, I think it's time to add some features to this website. Most notable, taking what was once at projects.jacksaenz.com and moving it to this site. This was my plan at one point, but I think I honestly decided against it because I didn't want to implement a hamburger menu, as silly as that sounds. Will I finally make that hamburger menu? Probably not, but I can definitely get rid of the weird subdomain thing that I had going on! With that I'm finally going to pull in all my projects and get this thing updated! It's an exciting time, I've got lots of things I'm working on, and hopefully a lot of progress that I can make while I'm on break.

            Well, as much as I've tried to make this blog something that I consistently work on, it turns out that it's pretty hard to find time for side projects like this in college. It's been about a month since I moved back home for the summer, and while I have gotten a fair amount done on other projects, I've been meaning to work on this blog again. I don't know how consistent I will be, given I've actually got quite a lot I can work on over the summer, but I'm going to try and get some more posts ready for this site. It really does feel good to be writing again.

            It's been over a month now since I started college. Although I knew it would be different, I didn't think that it would be as different as it is. It's mostly the same in that I still get up every day and go to class, but now I have so much control over my own decisions. Everyday I wake up and I can approach things however I want and <InternalLink client:visible link="/garden/thoughts/shades-of-perfect-blue" type="thought">that feeling</InternalLink> is incredible. While I've always felt happy, it feels as though I wake up each day with more joy than I ever have before. I'm glad to be where I'm at and I'm excited to see what will come.

            As I'm writing this I'm sitting in a chaise lounge looking out over the waters of Lake Michigan. It's been quite a while since I set out on my journey to rebuild my website from scratch, but I've finally hunkered down and gotten the work done. In about a month I will be starting classes at UT and I figured this blog would be a good way for me to keep people up to date with what I'm doing. I don't have any content yet but I've gotten the sight to a place where I'm ready to push it out to the world. With the blog in working order I'll have no excuses to procrastinate writing posts, so hopefully I'll be more motivated to write.

            Currently working on revamping this blog! Although I did like the old design it wasn't very easy to navigate and made expanding the site way harder than I would've liked for it to be. Plus now I've been fully indoctrinated into the whole idea of <ExternalLink client:visible link="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Digital Gardening</ExternalLink>, which I feel will fit my creative style a lot more than the typical process of running a blog. Beyond that I've recently accepted into ECE at University of Texas at Austin and am looking forward to joining classes next fall!
