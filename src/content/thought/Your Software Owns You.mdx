title: Your Software Owns You

brief: Some musings on an every present problem.
---

I think it's safe to venture that most of the people reading this pay for some
sort of software solution. If you're a designer, a photographer, or a
film-maker, you probably pay for Adobe. If you're an Engineer you probably pay
for Fusion 360, something by Autodesk, or for Solidworks. If you're in any sort
of business you probably pay for some Microsoft application. Whether your
company pays for it, or you pay for it, you are likely involved in the trade of
software. If you're involved in this trade, you no longer own your skill-set,
your expertise, or your experience, but a company does.

Long before I got into programming or using any of this software, I was of the
belief that this was a necessary evil. It sucks that I have to pay for these
items, but they need the money to maintain them, right? Having gone through the
development cycle, while that is not necessarily untrue, it is for the most part
something that companies have tried to convince us of. If you need evidence,
look into the plethora of free software that is well maintained despite that,

- KiCad
- Obsidian
- Nvim (What I'm using to edit this)
- Blender

And there's a lot more examples where that came from. The point is, it is not
impossible to make a program without charging users for it. The programs I
listed aren't even without sophistication; Blender for instance implements a
very sophisticated and industry standard 3D renderer[^1]. No matter what kind of
program you are making, you can make it free for anyone to use, and it will
still hold up. In fact, most of these programs are perceived as better than
their paid alternatives.

So, if it is possible to make software available for free, why isn't everyone
doing this? I don't think I have to tell anyone this, but it comes down to
profits. You can make software for free in a sustainable way, but not often in a
way that generates any profit. Most of these programs are made by non-profit
organizations that simply work to maintain a pool of contributors, which may or
may not be paid, as they all work together to make a product that can benefit
all of us. While I do think we'd be better off if every company was non-profit,
we're pretty much locked in a system that encourages that. So, as always, the
problem comes down to greed.

You may be asking, if other companies get to charge for their products, why
don't software companies? The problem is that once a company charges you to run
their software, they own your workflow. Want to improve your resume while you're
in between jobs? Want to work on projects in college that will make you a better
candidate once you graduate? Want to just make something for the hell of it?
Companies want you to pay industry pricing, and if you're not willing to pay, go
learn some other software instead of mastering what you know. While I'm not
against the idea of making companies pay for commercial licenses, no average
person should have to pay those same prices. It hurts the people who use the
software and it hurts those who might have been interested in getting into a new
hobby but who feel blocked by a pay wall.

## How do we fix this?

So, what's the solution? Greedy corporations aren't just going to change their
bottom line overnight. The best way to combat this problem is to work around it.
Go out of your way to avoid learning, and using, paid software; chances are,
there is an alternative, and it's probably better than the thing your were going
to pay for. More importantly, though, try to support these projects whenever you
can. A lot of free software is open source, and simply maintained by a bunch of
people who like working on it in their spare time. If you are a developer, try
contributing to the cause; if you use the software yourself, you will be better
at contributing to it. However, even if you are not a developer there are still
ways to help. Lots of these projects need help maintaining their documentation,
tutorials, and learning resources. With enough experience you can help teach
others how to use your favorite free software and make it more available to
others just starting out. If you have some money to spare, some projects do
accept donations. I know I just went on about how you shouldn't pay for
software[^2], but if you think something is so good it deserves compensation
then go ahead and support the creators. Lastly, never forget, you can always
pirate something.

[^1]: Check out the movie Flow to see just how well it is able to operate first
    hand. This movie was able to win an Academy Award, all while being produced
    entirely using free software. If Blender can do that, it can do anything.

[^2]: I should mention, that I do like the payment optional way of doing things.
    I'm always ready to support a project if I feel that it deserves some money,
    but I always believe it should be free upfront. Furthermore, the thing I
    most despise is subscription models. Paying for a lifetime license still
    sucks but it's better than paying for the rest of your life.
