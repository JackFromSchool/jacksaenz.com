For decades humans have been testing things

## Example

Ancient romans tested their water systems to make sure that they wouldn't leak. The did this by doing a "dry run". During a dry run they would pour sand through their aquaducts to see if any leaked through. This would ensure that when they connected the system to water no leaks would occur.

### Dry Run

Since then the term "Dry Run" was coined.

## In Conclusion

Blah Blah Blah the end.
