   This was my partner and I's final project for ECE 319H: Introduction to Embedded Systems Honors. It is a fully working recreation of the game battleship that was made using the MSPM0G350x series of microcontrollers.

   Key Skills
   * Learned how to interact with a microcontroller ecosystem; reading datasheets, understanding conventions.
   * Gained experience with using interrupts and atomic operations.
   * Build a robust event loop that matched the specific requirements for this project.
   * Gained experience in the principles of PCB design and circuit theory.
